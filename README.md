COMP 116 Fall 2014 ~~~Private~~~ **Public** Repo for Carter Casey  

This is the record of all submissions for the Computer System Security Class. I have some scripts that I wrote for previous assignments that I should upload, too, but they're currently in a much messier repo on the tufts.cs github.  

Our professor, Ming Chow, has asked us to answer the following questions in this README:  

* What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?  
I think my favorite assignment was our forensics assignment (there was so much to do), and my favorite lab was probably password cracking (the joy of finally cracking the harder passwords using parallel processing). On the other hand, if I make the effort to update and maintain my final project, I think it'll turn into my favorite (once I get it right).  

* How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?  
Hugely. My knowledge base for security has grown immensely, to the point I feel I can start exploring and learning about the world of security on my own.  

* What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.  
I have trouble choosing one thing that I consider the *most* important. I'll go with this: I now have a better understanding of how the internet works and is vulnerable. I have, since learning about network scanning and network protocols, realized a number of glaring vulnerabilities in my own life - the default password on my router, for instance, hadn't been changed until I thought to check it. I have a better appreciation for what I'm putting out there when I use the internet to connect with the world - a pretty large amount of information, unfortunately.  

* Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?  
Web and internet security. The internet is such an important place, and I'd like to understand how to better protect everything that's on it.
